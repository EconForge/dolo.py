Inspecting the solution
=======================

The output of most solution methods is a decision rule for the controls
as a function of the exogenous and endogenous states: `dr`. This
decision rule can be called using one of the following methods:

-   `dr.eval_s(s: array)`: function of endogenous state. Works only if
    exgogenous process is i.i.d.
-   `dr.eval_ms(m: array,s: array)`: function of exogenous and
    endogenous values. Works only if exogenous process is continuous.
-   `dr.eval_is(i: int,s: array)`: function of exognous index and
    endogenous values. Works only if some indexed discrete values are
    associated with exogenous process.

There is also a \_\_call\_\_ function, which tries to make the sensible
call based on argument types. Hence `dr(0, s)` will behave as the third
example.

Tabulating a decision rule
--------------------------

Dolo provides a convenience function to plot the values of a decision
rule against different values of a state:

Stochastic simulations
----------------------

Given a model object and a corresponding decision rule, one can get a
`N` stochastic simulation for `T` periods, using the `simulate`
function. The resulting object is an 3-dimensional *DataArray*, with the
following labelled axes:

- T: date of the simulation (`range(0,T)`)
- N: index of the simulation (`range(0,N)`)
- V: variables of the model (`model.variables`)

Impulse response functions
--------------------------

For continuously valued exogenous shocks, one can perform an impulse
response function:

Graphing nonstochastic simulations
----------------------------------

Given one or many nonstochstic simulations of a model, obtained with
`response`, or `deterministic_solve` it is possible to quickly create an
irf for multiple variables.
